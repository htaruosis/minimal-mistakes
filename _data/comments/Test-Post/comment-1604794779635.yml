message: "Results: The evidence needed to ascertain the clinical utility of routine \r\nhormonal blood tests was limited in terms of the \r\namount and interpretability. Studies were heterogenous with wide variations in the prevalence of hypogonadism or hyperprolactinemia \r\nin patients with ED. Overall phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors were superior to placebo in treating patients with ED with clinically \r\nimportant and statistically significant between-group differences.\r\nAdverse events however, were more frequent in PDE-5 inhibitor-treated patients.\r\nFew trials demonstrated dose-response trends in the degree of efficacy \r\nor frequency of adverse events associated with PDE-5 inhibitors.\r\nThe clinical benefits conferred by use of PDE-5 inhibitors relative to placebo were observed in patients with wide spectrum of comorbidities \r\nirrespective of the origin, duration, or severity of ED.\r\nIn head-to-head trials evaluating PDE-5 inhibitors, more \r\npatients preferred tadalafil to sildenafil or vardenafil.\r\nPatients treated with intracavernosal or subcutaneous injections experienced pain and priapism.\r\nThe evidence for topical, intra-urethral, and hormonal treatments for male ED was insufficient and inconclusive.\r\nprescription for viagra online buy viagra online no prescription"
